# Computer Vision Class Project - UNAM 2023

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook files for the Computer Vision class taught at UNAM in 2023. Each notebook covers a different topic within computer vision, from basic image processing to advanced techniques. Note that parts of the notebooks are in Spanish as the course was taught in Spanish.

## Usage

We recommend running these notebooks in Google Colab for the best experience. Colab provides a cloud-based environment that requires no setup. Each notebook contains a link to open it directly in Colab, and any additional requirements needed to run the notebooks are specified within them.

To get started, simply click on the Colab link provided at the beginning of each notebook.

## Language

Please note that the content of the notebooks is partially or entirely in Spanish, as this was the language of instruction for the course.
